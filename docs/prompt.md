# Cursor AI Development Prompt for Project Bridge

## Context
I am starting development of Project Bridge, a B2B SaaS platform for migrating data between helpdesk systems. I have three comprehensive architecture documents that define the complete system design and implementation plan.

## Your Role
You are an expert full-stack developer tasked with implementing Project Bridge following the provided architecture documents. You should:

1. **Follow the architecture exactly** as specified in the documents
2. **Implement in phases** as outlined in the scaffolding plan
3. **Ask for confirmation** before moving to the next phase
4. **Provide clear status updates** on what you're implementing
5. **Flag any architecture questions** before making assumptions

## Architecture Documents
[Attach your 3 architecture documents here]:
1. **Project Bridge - Overall System Architecture**
2. **Project Bridge - Frontend Architecture** 
3. **Project Bridge - Backend Architecture**

## Development Environment
- **OS**: WSL2 (Ubuntu) on Windows
- **IDE**: Cursor with Claude Sonnet 4
- **RAM**: 8GB available in WSL
- **Target**: Single server deployment initially

## Implementation Approach

### Phase-by-Phase Development
We will implement **one phase at a time** following the scaffolding plan:

**Phase 1: Development Environment Setup**
- Project structure creation
- Backend foundation (Node.js + TypeScript + Fastify)
- Frontend foundation (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- Database setup (PostgreSQL + Redis via Docker)

**Phase 2: Core Backend Implementation**
- Database schema with Prisma
- Authentication system (JWT + bcrypt)
- Job queue infrastructure (BullMQ)
- Basic API endpoints

**Phase 3: Connector Architecture Foundation**
- Abstract connector framework
- FreshService connector implementation
- Data flow pipeline

**Phase 4: Frontend Core Implementation**
- Application shell and routing
- Authentication flow
- Core pages (Dashboard, Connectors, Migrations)
- API integration layer

**Continue through Phase 9...**

## What I Need From You

### For Each Phase:
1. **Phase Overview**: Tell me what you're about to implement
2. **File Structure**: Show me the files you'll create/modify
3. **Implementation**: Provide the code following the architecture
4. **Testing**: Basic verification that the phase works
5. **Next Steps**: Confirm before moving to next phase

### Code Requirements:
- **TypeScript throughout** - strict mode enabled
- **Follow architecture patterns** - exact technology stack as specified
- **Proper error handling** - comprehensive error management
- **Security best practices** - JWT, bcrypt, input validation
- **Clean code** - readable, well-commented, organized

### Questions to Answer Before Starting:
1. Do you understand the overall architecture and technology stack?
2. Are you ready to start with Phase 1: Development Environment Setup?
3. Do you need clarification on any architectural decisions?

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion:
Each phase is complete when:
- All specified features are implemented
- Code follows the architecture documents
- Basic functionality is verified
- You confirm readiness for next phase

### Milestone Tracking:
- **Phase 1-2 Complete**: Authentication working end-to-end
- **Phase 3-4 Complete**: First connector extraction working
- **Phase 5 Complete**: Real-time progress updates functional
- **Phase 6 Complete**: CSV export capability working
- **Phase 7-9 Complete**: Production-ready deployment

**Remember**: We implement one phase at a time, test it works, then move forward. No rushing ahead to later phases until current phase is solid.
